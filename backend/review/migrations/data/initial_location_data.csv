The food is amazing and we both got the Thai Islamic Noodles. Service is fast and very efficient, but we always feel rushed there. Their turnover of customers is always so quick. Mind you, it is a student spot so this makes sense. Regardless, this restaurant has the best Thai food and it is well worth it!
-Salad king is my favourite Thai place in Toronto! It is affordable (an effort they do to make the students from TMU be able to buy food from here),incredibly delicious and very well-portioned. The trifecta of food when eating out.I went out with by boyfriend and our mothers. They both got the battered shrimp fried rice with sweet chili oil, my bf got the panang curry and I get my signature: chicken Siam noodles. We all had to take our food home because of the amount of food that we got. For the 20$ you will pay,it is worth it. Please visit this place it is a downtown staple!",2,50

Many of the customers the staff knew by name l. I ordered a strawberry shake to start. It arrived in the stainless cup, but was not full, I would have expected there to be more but after trying it, the taste made me focus less on the quantity and more so on the deliciousness! I ordered fish & chips and my lunch arrived very quickly. Two sizeable pieces of haddock which I was impressed with. Very good batter, crispy like how I like it. Thick as well. Fries were good with some malt vinegar and the coleslaw was perfect, creamy and as if they just shredded it. A very good experience and the staff were excellent, dropping by my table to ensure if everything was  to my liking. I’ll definitely be back.
-met a friend for lunch here today and the restaurant was lively. even with most of the tables filled up and staff moving around constantly, a server kindly greeted and welcomed me. noticed that the service was generally pretty quick, which was great since we were on a bit of a time crunch. i ordered fran’s energy breakfast and my friend got the nachos please (added homemade chili). i didn’t get to try my friend’s order (again, we were in a rush), but my meal was alright. the egg was big, but the slice of ham was very thin (could barely taste it) and the homemade fries were mid (not the best i’ve ever had). overall, the service was great (attentive and energetic, despite how busy and chaotic it was), but i probably won’t order the same meal again (for that price at least).",3,25

-Delicious food at a very reasonable cost for the area! If you’re looking for authentic Middle Eastern, this is definitely worth a try. The falafel is perfectly crispy on the outside and perfectly smooth on the inside. The hummus is velvety smooth and the pita is hot and fluffy when it arrives.

This time around I had the bacon cheese burger (2 beef patties) (everything on it) with fries & gravy.  I was offered a drink but passed.  Had a craving for milk but sadly it's not available.  They do have shakes though. The gravy is on point.  Sticks to your fries and has a good flavour.
-When the urge for a burger strikes, Five Guys is the go-to spot. While you wait, enjoy complimentary peanuts, and discover the daily source of their fresh potato produce",1,30

Sadly a new tower has gone up right next door, which blocks any CN Tower views. Warm cookies at check-in is also a nice touch.
Unfortunately our stay was not perfect, as midway through my shower the water started coming out dark brown for about 20 seconds. The front-desk sent up their “engineering” team to have a look, who just told me to run the water for 5 minutes before using it. Considering this happened in the middle of my shower, I don’t see how that would help…
It didn’t completely ruin the stay for me, but there definitely shouldn’t be brown water coming out of the taps in a Hilton brand property…
