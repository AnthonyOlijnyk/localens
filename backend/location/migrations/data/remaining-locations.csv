The food is amazing and we both got the Thai Islamic Noodles. Service is fast and very efficient, but we always feel rushed there. Their turnover of customers is always so quick. Mind you, it is a student spot so this makes sense. Regardless, this restaurant has the best Thai food and it is well worth it!
-Salad king is my favourite Thai place in Toronto! It is affordable (an effort they do to make the students from TMU be able to buy food from here),incredibly delicious and very well-portioned. The trifecta of food when eating out.I went out with by boyfriend and our mothers. They both got the battered shrimp fried rice with sweet chili oil, my bf got the panang curry and I get my signature: chicken Siam noodles. We all had to take our food home because of the amount of food that we got. For the 20$ you will pay,it is worth it. Please visit this place it is a downtown staple!",2,50

Many of the customers the staff knew by name l. I ordered a strawberry shake to start. It arrived in the stainless cup, but was not full, I would have expected there to be more but after trying it, the taste made me focus less on the quantity and more so on the deliciousness! I ordered fish & chips and my lunch arrived very quickly. Two sizeable pieces of haddock which I was impressed with. Very good batter, crispy like how I like it. Thick as well. Fries were good with some malt vinegar and the coleslaw was perfect, creamy and as if they just shredded it. A very good experience and the staff were excellent, dropping by my table to ensure if everything was  to my liking. I’ll definitely be back.
-met a friend for lunch here today and the restaurant was lively. even with most of the tables filled up and staff moving around constantly, a server kindly greeted and welcomed me. noticed that the service was generally pretty quick, which was great since we were on a bit of a time crunch. i ordered fran’s energy breakfast and my friend got the nachos please (added homemade chili). i didn’t get to try my friend’s order (again, we were in a rush), but my meal was alright. the egg was big, but the slice of ham was very thin (could barely taste it) and the homemade fries were mid (not the best i’ve ever had). overall, the service was great (attentive and energetic, despite how busy and chaotic it was), but i probably won’t order the same meal again (for that price at least).",3,25

Free breakfast is an amazing bonus - the selection was good and the amount of food you get is amazing!

The interior was bigger than we expected. We ordered $13.5 regular classic beef noodles and $15.95 braised beef noodles. The dishes were on par with the best we've had before. The noodle texture was great, and the portion was large with a good amount of beef and radish. My only few nitpicks are that one of the menus was worn out to the point that we couldn't read some parts, and the classic beef was very soft and fell apart easily. Note that the spice levels are quite mild, even with a mediocre spice tolerance (the server said kids are fine with 1 pepper spice level)                                                                                                                                                       -The noodles were excellent and reasonably priced!

Our favourites were the garlic butter shrimp and the grilled shrimp skewer with fresh lemon. The garlic butter shrimp was very flavourful and always served hot and I definitely suggest trying it.

The island jumbo coconut shrimp was nice and had a slightly sweet taste to it. The popcorn shrimp and Walt’s favorite shrimp were alright only because the breading didn’t add any flavour and the oil it was prepared in made it taste a bit bitter. I wouldn’t get those two options again.

The service was great and our waitress was very friendly :) I would definitely come back just for the garlic butter shrimp and their cheddar bay biscuits!                                                                                                   -Service and food preparation were on point at this location!

It's been years since my partner and I had red lobster so we decided to pop in and try their endless shrimp. Food was prepared well, portions were good, and value is excellent. Tastes and flavours were just as I remembered, basically butter and salt, but expectations were met and everything was cooked well.

Service was absolutely amazing and our server Sherif went above an beyond to be accommodating and ensure we were well taken care of. Definitely made our experience extra enjoyable and would be back strictly because of the service.

While there's many better options for seafood across the city, Red Lobster holds that iconic family seafood restaurant status and this location holds up well. Great for a date or family outing, we'll definitely be back when craving some buttery biscuits and endless shrimp!",3,35
